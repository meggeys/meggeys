- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @meggeys. 26, beginner coder and trying to spread love and happiness in the world.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in... good question. Non-coding related stuff would be music (like actually making music, not only listening)
and video games, even tho I'm a noob in every game I play :D
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python (3). And... let me say I could be better :D
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: my username is the same everywhere. You should be able to find me on most social media platforms, just shoot me a DM :D
